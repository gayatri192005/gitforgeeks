Git:
What is Git?

Git is a version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project, track changes, and revert to previous versions if necessary.
Key Git Concepts:

Repository (Repo): A project folder managed by Git, containing files and the complete history of changes.
Commit: A snapshot of changes made to files in the repository.
Branch: A separate line of development, allowing you to work on a new feature without affecting the main code.
Merge: Combining changes from different branches.
Clone: Copying an entire repository from a remote server to your local machine.
Pull: Fetching changes from a remote repository to update your local repository.
Push: Sending your local changes to a remote repository.
Basic Git Commands:

git init: Initialize a new Git repository.
git clone [url]: Clone an existing repository from GitHub or another server.
git status: Check the current status of your project.
git add [file]: Stage files for committing.
git commit -m "message": Commit changes with a message.
git pull: Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository.
git push: Push local commits to the remote repository.
git checkout [branch]: Switch to a different branch.
